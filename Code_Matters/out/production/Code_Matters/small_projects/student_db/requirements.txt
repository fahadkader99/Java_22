I am DB admin for a university and need to create an application to manage student enrollments and balance

Application should do the following:

- Ask the user how many new students will be added to DB
- the user should be prompt to enter the name and year for each student
- student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
- Student can enroll in the following courses:
    - History 101
    - Math 101
    - English 101
    - Chemistry 101
    - Computer science 101

- each course cost $600 to enroll
- the student should be able to view their balance and pay tuition
- status = we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled and balance
