Student Database Application

Scenario: I am a database Administrator for a university and need to create an application to manage student enrollments and balance.


# Application should do the following:

- ask the user how many new students will be added to the database
- the user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
- the student should have a 5 digit unique id, with the first number being their grade level
- A student can enroll in the following course:

    - History 101
    - Mathematics 101
    - English 101
    - Chemistry 101
    - Computer Science 101

- each course cost $600 to enroll
- the student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
- To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance.
